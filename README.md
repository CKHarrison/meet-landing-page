## My process
As usual with these challenges I focused on designing this project using a mobile first workflow starting with a mobile view. From there I progressed to a tablet view, and then finally the desktop flow. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  
### What I learned
I've used SASS in the past, but never really felt comfortable with it, so I used this challenge as a way to get more comfortable with it. I really enjoyed using the partial functionality. It really helped me organize my CSS is modules that were easy for me to understand. 

I've had issues with overlaying colors over images in the past, like in the footer. So I took special care in this challenge to find a easier/more maintainable way to do it. CSS tips and tricks was incredibly helpful for this problem. You can find the link to the page in the resources below.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tips & Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/apply-a-filter-to-a-background-image/) - This article really helped me figure out how to easily overlay tinting over images. Usually I'd just do it in photoshop and then import the image, but I took this challenge as an opportunity to figure out a pure CSS solution.
- [SASS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM) - This was a great video to help me polish up on my SASS skills. I've been used to using the built in functionality with Create React App and Ruby on Rails, so this was a good way of learning how to manually compile the SASS.
